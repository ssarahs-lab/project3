HabitMakr - where big things come from small beginnings

## Technologies used
Javascript, AJAX, NodeJS, ExpressJS, PostgreSQL client, PostgresQL

## Approach taken
Habitmakr is a single page app that helps encourage a user to make habits based on small achievable steps. 

The app builds upon concepts derived from Atomic Habits, a popular self-help guide developed by James Clear; on the belief that small, incremental, everyday routines compound into massive, positive change over time.

Users begin by signing up to an account, and choosing some small tasks to incorporate into their everyday routine. 

The app then displays daily/weekly/monthly progress in a variety of statistics and graphs.
